# CNN Find Glasses in Faces

# Main Idea

The idea of this project is to develop a CNN to recognize glasses in Faces.

# Steps

1) Convert all images to idx3 - Ubyte 

2) Run a manual convolutional with a filter for edge detecter

3) With the results, make the picture a little brighter by reducing the size by half.

4) Feed the final result to a CNN/ANN, to classify a picture as having glass or not.
